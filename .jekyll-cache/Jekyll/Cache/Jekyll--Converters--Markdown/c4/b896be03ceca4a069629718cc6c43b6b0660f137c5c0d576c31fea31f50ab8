I"¿<p>If youâ€™re training or sampling from generative models, <strong>typicality</strong> is a concept worth understanding. It sheds light on why beam search doesnâ€™t work for autoregressive models of images, audio and video; why you canâ€™t just threshold the likelihood to perform anomaly detection with generative models; and why high-dimensional Gaussians are â€œsoap bubblesâ€. This post is a summary of my current thoughts on the topic.</p>
